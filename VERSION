Bug Fixes: Start Game Button + Host Disconnect Handling

Fixed two critical issues in multiplayer functionality.

Issue 1: Start Game Button Not Showing
Root Cause:
- updateStartButtonState() was using old isReady/opponentReady variables
- New team-based system stores ready status in currentRoomState.players[socketId].ready
- Function wasn't checking roomState, causing button to never show

Changes:
- Rewrote updateStartButtonState() to use currentRoomState instead of legacy variables
- Added proper host detection using currentRoomState.hostSocket === socket.id
- Added team capacity checks (1v1: 1 per team, 3v3: 1+ per team)
- Added comprehensive debugging logs with [START-CHECK] prefix
- Button now correctly shows when: all players ready + both teams filled + game not started

Issue 2: Host Disconnect Not Handled
Root Cause:
- When host closed browser, guests remained in room with no way to start game
- No notification sent to remaining players

Changes:
- Added hostDisconnected event handler
- When host disconnects, all players receive alert: "Host has left the room. Room is now closed."
- Players automatically return to main menu
- Room is deleted from server

Previous Fixes (V415):
- Fixed handleTeamSelect() to allow first-time team selection in 1v1 mode
- Only blocks team switching after player is already assigned to a team
- Added comprehensive debugging logs to track team selection flow
