Bug Fix: Team Selection Logic in 1v1 Mode

Fixed critical issue where players couldn't select teams in 1v1 mode.

Root Cause:
- handleTeamSelect() was blocking ALL team selection in 1v1 mode
- Should only block team SWITCHING, not initial team selection

Changes:
- Fixed handleTeamSelect() to allow first-time team selection in 1v1 mode
- Only blocks team switching after player is already assigned to a team
- Added comprehensive debugging logs to track team selection flow
- Added detailed logging in updateTeamBasedUI() to track roomState processing
